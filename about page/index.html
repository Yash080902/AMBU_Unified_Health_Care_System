          <p  class="para"><b>We are building a platform, a website, and an application on which users can request an ambulance in less time. They can upload health-related documents to our cloud, donate or request blood on our portal, and order medicine in an emergency in a short period of time. On our app, we have also integrated a medicine recommender system. This can suggest which medicines are best for you, and from our platform, you can also order those medicines quickly. As part of this platform, we have developed a portal through which patients can communicate with our doctors online.</b></p>
          <br>
          <p class="para"><b>Our main goal is to reduce the distance between the patient and the hospital by implementing our location-tracking system so that ambulances can reach their exact location in the shortest time possible. Through our navigation system, ambulances will choose the shortest path and the least congested route.</b></p>
